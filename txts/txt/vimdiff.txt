vimdiff with git
================

To merge files, you can run

    git merge

Which will by default launch vimdiff

Vim basics
==========

Vim is an annoying editor. When not in insert mode, you can run commands by typing ':mycommandhere'

Git merge basics
================

Git creates 3 files when merging changes to one file. One of REMOTE/BASE/LOCAL get added to the filename:

    REMOTE: The version that you pulled
    BASE: The version from a prior commit, before versions of files got different
    LOCAL: The file on your machine

Appart from these three files, you will still have the file with the original name. 
This is where you have to merge your changes and it appears as the bottom buffer of the vimdiff screen.


Insert mode
===========

Generally not useful when vimdiffing, but insert mode:
    :i, ESC to come out

Using lines from other buffers to resolve merge
===============================================

Use REMOTE: 
    :diffget REMOTE
Use BASE: 
    :diffget BASE
Use LOCAL: 
    :diffget LOCALE

Save all and exit: 
    :wqa
