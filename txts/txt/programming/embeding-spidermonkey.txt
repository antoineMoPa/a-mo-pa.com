How to build SpiderMonkey in Debian
============================================

SpiderMonkey is Mozilla's javascript engine. You can use it for fun  and profit.

You will probably need to build spidermonkey if you want to embed it in an application.

These building instructions are for Debian. They could work with Ubuntu and they should be easy to adapt for other distributions. 

Step 1: Download a snapshot of the Mozilla-central mercurial tree
-----------------------------------

Use the "gz" link at the top of the screen in the following page

[http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip]

Step 2.1: Uncompress the archive:
-------------------

[terminal]
gunzip -d mozilla-central-*.tar.gz
[/terminal]

Step 2.2: Untar the .tar:
--------------------------

[terminal]
tar -xvf mozilla-central-*.tar
[/terminal]

You may want to move the extracted folder in ~/src, it is up to you

Note: I did this in 2 steps because tar `-zxvf failed`

Step 3: Get autoconf 2.13
----------------------

Seems like the developers have not updated the code to work with newer versions.

[terminal]
sudo apt-get install autoconf2.13
[/terminal]

Step 4: Build
--------------

Time to build. From the "building spidermonkey" link:

(this will take time)

[terminal]
cd js/src
autoconf-2.13

mkdir build-release
cd build-release
../configure
make
[/terminal]


Step 5: See if build worked
--------------------

Run the javascript shell that was built and see if it works;

[terminal]
# Should return 1
dist/bin/js -e "print(Math.cos(2*Math.PI))"
[/terminal]
