Fight blue light at night in Linux
=====================

For health reasons, you should try to reduce the amount of blue light that reaches your eyes at night.

I use command line tools to alter the colors of my screen when working late. This way, I minimize the effects on my biological clock.

Tools
========

You have to use redshift and xcalib. Both are available in debian package archives.

[terminal]
sudo apt-get install xcalib redshift
[/terminal]

'Reset' colors
==========

Before using the code below, learn how to reset the changes (see below). If you end up with an entirely black/white screen, you will know what to type.

You can use the following terminal line to get back to normal if you mess up with xcalib and redshift:

[terminal]
redshift -O 5000
[/terminal]

Now, this is how I like my screen at night:

[terminal]
# Change the CCT
redshift -O 3400
# Reduce blue light
xcalib -blue 0.2 1 1 -alter
# I like green better than red
xcalib -red 0.8 1 1 -alter

# Now the colors are all yellow-ish
# but I can still read texts 
# and do some work before going to sleep

[/terminal]

Expected results
===========

You should feel tired faster:

This means you have to sleep. In a certain way, blue light would have 'hidden' that fact from you.


Going further
=========

Many lamps emit blue light. Feel free to shut off the lamps around you for better results.
