How to take sound output from debian to a raspberry pi
======================================================

So I wanted to plug my raspberry pi to a sound system and stream music from my laptop to it.

My laptop is on the same network as my PI and this method requires you to know the laptop's subnetwork IP.


ON DEBIAN:
----------

[terminal]
apt-get install icecast2 darkice pavucontrol
[/terminal]

Create a file named darkice.cfg with this content
[code]
[general]
duration        = 0      # duration in s, 0 forever
bufferSecs      = 1      # buffer, in seconds
reconnect       = yes    # reconnect if disconnected

[input]
device          = default # or `pulse' for Pulseaudio
sampleRate      = 44100   # sample rate 11025, 22050 or 44100
bitsPerSample   = 16      # bits
channel         = 2       # 2 = stereo

[icecast2-0]
bitrateMode     = vbr       # variable bit rate (`cbr' constant, `abr' average)
quality         = 1.0       # 1.0 is best quality
format          = vorbis       # format. Choose `vorbis' for OGG Vorbis
bitrate         = 256       # bitrate
server          = localhost # or IP
port            = 8000      # port for IceCast2 access
password        = hackme    # source password to the IceCast2 server
mountPoint      = stream.ogg  # mount point on the IceCast2 server .mp3 or .ogg
name            = stream
[/code]

Start server:

[terminal]
darkice -c darkice.cfg
[/terminal]


Audio setup with pavucontrol
--------------

With pavucontrol, I had to go enable and raise the volume of ALSA Capture and turn off Internal audio. You'll have to look for those settings. In french, it was respectively: "Enregistrement" (Recording) and "Configuration" (Same as french)

ON RASPBERRY PI:
---------------

[terminal]
sudo apt-get install mplayer
# Update to whatever your ip is
mplayer 192.168.0.50:8000/stream.ogg
[/terminal]
