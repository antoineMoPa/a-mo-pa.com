## About that code ##

This is the code for my [website](http://a-mo-pa.com) which is currently a javascript & canvas playground.

In the txts folder, there are .txt files and a ruby script to assemble them in a html container. That's how I do content management...

### Features  ###

* A really dumb 3d renderer
  * Does not know whether a face is closer to the camera than another
  * Uses a really weird & basic 3d to 2d converter
    (It scales everything down with a factor applied to the z axis)
  * It does the job to render nice artistic things
* Weird squares
* Weird spirals
* Weird interference patterns
